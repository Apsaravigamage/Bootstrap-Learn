                <p>Let’s be real, polydactyl cats give the best high-fives. Errr, high-sixes. Also known as "mitten cats"
                 or "thumb cats," polydactyls have a genetic mutation that gives them more than the usual number of toes 
                 on one or more feet. Polydactyl cats can have anywhere from six to eight toes per paw. The extra toes
                 sometimes make them look like their paws have thumbs. While polydactyly can happen in many different
                 animals (including humans), it’s arguably cutest in cats. Writer Ernest Hemingway certainly thought 
                 so—he himself was a polydactyl owner, and the Ernest Hemingway Home and Museum is now home to some 50 
                 polydactyl cats.</p>

                <button class="btn btn-outline-primary">videos</button>
                <p>With its white muzzle and feet, dark "points," and blue eyes, the Snowshoe looks like what it was bred
                 from: a Siamese with white "boots" that turned up in the litter of a Siamese breeder in Philadelphia in 
                 the 1960s. The particular Snowshoe look is difficult to breed, so registered purebred Snowshoe cats are 
                 rare. But there are many cats in shelters who have some or all of its traits, such as the white paws,
                 dark mask, and beautiful blue eyes—so if you’re interested in this kind of cat, you can always get "the
                 look for less."</p>

                <p>It is impossible to clone a calico cat with the same markings, because of the random activation of 
                genes. The necessary traits for calico patterning are on the X-chromosome, therefore nearly all calico 
                cats are female. Male calico cats are few and far between, and can only exist as a result of genetic 
                defect. </p>

                <p>The British Shorthair is known for both its looks and its typically easygoing and fun-loving 
                personality. The appealing chunkiness of its face and body and its plush, thick fur match its sturdy 
                temperament. The wide-cheeked faces of British Shorthairs appear to be smiling and more expressive than 
                many cat breeds’, and it’s said that they were the inspiration for the wide-grinning Cheshire Cat of
                Lewis Carroll’s Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland.

                <p> Who can resist the Siamese cat’s pretty blue eyes? These cats have been valued for their unique
                 patterning and outspoken personalities for centuries. Long a status symbol, Siamese cats have been given
                 to dignitaries as gifts. They made their U.S. debut in 1878 when one was given to President Rutherford B.
                 Hayes and his wife by an American consul. These cats are especially known as being very vocal—their loud 
                 meows are sometimes mistaken for babies crying! Popular since the 19th century, this breed of cat 
                 originated in Thailand (formerly known as Siam).

                <p>Japanese Bobtails are like cats on the front end and rabbits on the back end. Just let that sink in for 
                a minute. It’s almost too cute to handle. Kitties with bunny tails? Sign me up. These adorable critters 
                are native to Japan, and have been around long enough to score appearances in traditional art. Unlike 
                most dogs with "docked" tails, Japanese Bobtails come by their stubby tails naturally. The genetic
                mutation that causes the tail reduces the number of vertebrae present. And did I mention they like to 
                play fetch?</p>
